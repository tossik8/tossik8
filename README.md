# Hi there, I'm Tossik8! 👋

I am a **CS major** who is passionate about **software development**. I enjoy building new products - it is so fascinating! There are so many things to consider, so many roadblocks to face, so many challenges to solve. Addmittedly, it is frustrating sometimes, BUT as Chris Bosh said, "Legends aren't defined by their successes, they're defined by how they bounce back from their failures." So, I get over the frustrations and figure out how to overcome the obstacles I am facing in order to build useful, remarkable, and impactful products.
